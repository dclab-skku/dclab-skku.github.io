I (강동현) am currently interested in the broad area of system software including operating systems, file and storage systems (for NAND flash memory and byte-addressable NVRAM), and artificial intelligence (AI) systems. The main research goal is to bridge the gap between applications and hardware effectively by improving the design and implementation of computer systems in terms of performance, cost, and reliability.

Before joining Gachon University (GCU) in March 2023, I worked as an assistant professor at Changwon National University (CWNU) from September 2020 to February 2023 and Dongguk University (DGU) from March 2019 to August 2020. I was a senior software engineer at Samsung Electronics from March 2018 to February 2019. I completed my Ph.D. at Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU) in 2018. At SKKU, I was a member of the Distributed Computing Laboratory (DCLab) led by Prof. Young Ik Eom. For storage systems, I have closely collaborated with Prof. Sang-Won Lee and Prof. Changwoo Min.
