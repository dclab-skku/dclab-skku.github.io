I (민창우) am a computer scientist, software developer, and lifelong open-source enthusiast.

My particular fascination lies in the interplay between hardware, operating systems, and compilers at a low level. This curiosity propelled me to pursue a PhD in Computer Science, focusing my research on the design of operating systems, software security, computer architecture, and their intricate interactions.

Linux kernel and compiler technologies hold a special place in my heart, and I find great joy in delving into their inner workings.

When I’m not immersed in these technical pursuits, I indulge in my love for photography, relish a good cup of coffee, and cherish precious moments spent with my loved ones, as I proudly fulfill the role of a devoted father to my son.
