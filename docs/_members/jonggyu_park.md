I (박종규) am Jonggyu Park, a Post-doc researcher at the University of Washington, advised by Tom Anderson and Simon Peter. My research interests include operating systems, storage, containers, and now energy-efficiency.

I received my B.S., M.S. (advised by Euiseong Seo), and Ph.D. (advised by Young Ik Eom) from Sungkyunkwan University in 2014, 2016, and 2022, respectively.
